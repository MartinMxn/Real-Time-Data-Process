# Spark

## Respond to limitations of Apache Hadoop -> in memory computing
## Master Slave mode
Master -> cluster manager  

## Resilient distributed dataset -> RDD

# Mesos
cluster dispatch（调度） management   
some service may cost memory more, and some cost CPU more, mesos is to manage and dipatch the resource better  
fairly match task with resources, work with different resource type  
## Truen datacenter/cluster into one computer

## Framework
Framework in Mesos is a distributed application developed with Mesos API

## Allocation module decide resources for each framework
## Framework Scheduler decide resources for each tasks

## Dominant resource fairness (DRF)
DRF tries to maximize min dominant resource share
